        <p class="lead">
          The Wartime Maritime Memorial Association C.I.C. is a Community Interest Company limited by guarantee and it honours, preserves, and shares the legacy of Britain’s wartime maritime service—not only through the vessels and archives we protect, but through the people who continue that story today. In plain terms, that means every ounce of effort and every spare pound goes back into the vessels, archives, and people who tell Britain’s wartime maritime story.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this, the aim is to build a community that honours, preserves, and shares the legacy of Britain’s wartime maritime service in living, practical ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Membership is how people plug into that mission. Every application is checked to be sure the community benefit lock stays safe, our not-for-profit promise holds, and the new member is ready to share skills or stories for the common good. There is no fee—just a shared commitment.

          The Plank Grant Scheme is our flagship programme. Director Members oversee each grant round, while Heritage, Custodian, and Friend Members contribute evidence, case studies, and volunteer hours that guide Board decisions.

        <p>
          Applications are weighed against our charitable objects and the need to prioritise community benefit. Results are logged in the Association’s minutes and shared so custodians can learn from successful projects.

        <p class="mb-0">
          Successful applicants share updates and photographs once their plank is replaced, helping the Association celebrate the volunteers behind every repair and keep records tidy.
