# Website Brief

for **The Wartime Maritime Memorial Trust**

---

## 1. Purpose

The website will serve as the public face of the Trust — a living digital memorial that honours the vessels and crews who served during wartime, preserves their stories, and celebrates those who care for them today.

It will inform, inspire, and invite engagement through:

- Educational resources
- Archival content
- Restoration support
- Commemorative storytelling

The site should blend dignity and accessibility, balancing remembrance with active participation.

## 2. Core Aims Reflected Online

### Aim 1 — Remembrance and Commemoration

To honour all who served at sea in wartime — from the Royal Naval Patrol Service and Coastal Forces to the Dunkirk Little Ships and other auxiliary fleets.

**Website focus:** Memorial pages, roll of honour, stories of service, annual remembrance events.

### Aim 2 — Preservation and Restoration Support

To preserve historic vessels and assist owners with small grants for restoration and maintenance of wartime craft.

**Website focus:** "Grants & Support" section, eligibility guidance, application portal, showcase of funded projects.

### Aim 3 — Education and Public Understanding

To advance education in Britain’s wartime maritime heritage through research, digital archives, and outreach programmes.

**Website focus:** Archive portal, educational resources, video/oral history gallery, links to schools and museums.

### Aim 4 — Archival Record and Digital Registry

To maintain and share an up-to-date record of surviving wartime vessels — their current condition, history, and ownership where appropriate.

**Website focus:** Interactive database and vessel registry (searchable by name, service, or type), maps and photo galleries.

### Aim 5 — The Living Story: Custodians and Communities

To tell the continuing story of the current custodians who preserve these vessels today — celebrating their dedication, skills, and stewardship as a living link to the past.

**Website focus:** "Custodians" stories and profiles, photo essays, interviews, and restoration diaries.

> “Every ship that survives does so because someone cares — we tell their story too.”
