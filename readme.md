# The Wartime Maritime Memorial Trust Website

This repository hosts the groundwork for The Wartime Maritime Memorial Trust's official website. The site will serve as a living digital memorial that honours wartime vessels and their crews while spotlighting the custodians who preserve their legacy today.

## Project Overview

The initial project brief outlines the Trust's online goals, the audiences we aim to reach, and the planned structure for the website experience. Key priorities include:

- Providing educational resources, archival material, and commemorative storytelling.
- Supporting preservation efforts through grant information and restoration showcases.
- Maintaining a searchable registry of surviving wartime vessels.
- Celebrating the volunteers, restorers, and communities who keep these histories alive.

For the full creative and technical direction, see [`docs/website-brief.md`](docs/website-brief.md).

## Next Steps

Future updates will translate the brief into a working site architecture, establish a visual identity that balances remembrance with accessibility, and implement the required content management and registry features.
